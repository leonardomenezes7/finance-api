# 💰 Finance API

I developed an API using Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL that allows users to register personal financial transactions. The recorded data includes the transaction name, amount, and type, which can be either credit or debit. This structure facilitates personal finance management by enabling each user to track and organize their financial movements efficiently.
